## R Markdown

```{r}
reddit <- read.csv('reddit.csv')
table(reddit$employment.status)
summary(reddit)
str(reddit)

levels(reddit$age.range)
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data = reddit, x = age.range)

#ordering levels of factors 
reddit$age.range <- factor(reddit$age.range, levels = c('Under 18','18-24','25-34','35-44','45-54','55-64','65 of Above'), ordered = T)

# alternate to order levels 
reddit$age.range <- ordered(reddit$age.range, levels = c('Under 18','18-24','25-34','35-44','45-54','55-64','65 of Above'))

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
